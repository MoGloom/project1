scene bg car_interior with fade

"<Intro movie – end on the starry sky, pan down to the road and through rear passenger side window of a car>"

"<movie music continues to play a short ways into this scene, fading out a couple lines in (followed by only the ambient sounds of the car)>"

"<CG/BG of the view from the back seat window>"

">>ambient car sounds (loop)"

">>thump [[shake]"

"I drift out of some faraway, blurry memory as the music fades."

"All I can remember of it is rain. Rain and blackness."

Voice "Are you awake, Erik?"

"It's dark and dreamy outside the window, but inside the car is sharp and alive."

"The lights of buttons and displays stab out of the dark. The engine rumbles quietly."

"I can feel the pressure of the seat under me, the friction of plasticy fabric against my cheek. Yeah, I'm definitely awake."

erik "Yeah, mom."

"Sitting up straight again, I pull a pair of ear buds out of my ears and rub the warm spot the seat belt left on the side of my face."

mom "We'll be there soon. Your father says it isn't much further."

"<Wilhelm car interior (night)>"

"Her face is silhouetted in profile against the colourless expanse ahead of us. It rushes by, photographed for a second in the headlights before it vanishes again."

"I think she's smiling. My mother, I mean."

erik "Okay."

mom "Maybe another half-hour. How are you feeling?"

erik "I'm fine."

"While I'm in here, nothing out there exists except as a distant memory. The past is fading behind me. The future still doesn't seem exactly real."

"Somehow that's more comforting than the alternative."

erik "I think I might just go to sleep when we get there."

mom "That's alright. I think we could use the rest too."

"Only the top of the my father's head is visible beside her, nodding slightly with the rhythm of the uneven road."

mom "I'm sorry it's taking so long."

erik "I just don't want to seem like I'm avoiding anyone..."

mom "No, no, dear. They'll understand. It's been a long drive."

mom "You'll have lots of time tomorrow to spend with your sisters."

mom "I'm sure your father and I will be out for a few hours."

mom "You know how your father is. He'll want to see every inch of the school."

"The school."

"That one word brings the future into focus again. It makes it real and gives it a name: Privatsonderkolleg St. Dymphna."

"That's where I'll be spending the better part of the next year."

"I fall silent for a minute while I dwell on that fact. My mother eventually turns back to the road."

"I put the ear buds back in and return to the window."

"<CG/BG of the view from the back seat window>"

"Resting my head again, I watch the dark trees against the light of the moon, satisfied in the knowledge that, for now, everything out there is safely behind the glass."

"<[[slow fade out/timelapse]>"

">>car ambience fades out"

"..."

"I'm falling."

"<[[open eyes to] Wilhelm car interior (night (with street lights outside the windshield?))>"

"Every muscle tenses to hold me back from tumbling forward, but something holds me fast."

"Eyes snap open. Lungs suck in air."

"All in preparation for..."

"Nothing. The seat belt supports me gently at the chest."

">>car door opening"

"I pick up my head as the door next to me opens and light splashes in."

mother "We're here, love."

"She's standing there next to my father, who rests his hand on the top of the door like a chauffeur."

"Unbuckling the belt, I stumble out."

"My mother takes me by the hand, the way you would a child's if you were worried he might wander away, and eases me onto my travel-atrophied legs and into the bright light of street lamps."

"<Wilhelm sisters' flat exterior (night)>"

"In front of us is a large, stately-looking building with an entrance all warmly lit and welcoming."

"The discomfort of leaving my glass-and-steel bubble is dulled a bit for a moment by the soft red brick and well-groomed bushes in the yellow light."

"With my mother leading the way and my father trailing behind, in no time we've made our way through the front door and up a winding staircase to the third or fourth floor."

"I don't bother counting."

"<Wilhelm sisters' flat hallway (night)>"

"Then we stop in front of an unassuming off-white door."

"They take turns knocking. My mother's soft, respectable taps first, then my father's quick, sharp strikes. The door swings open only a moment after the second volley."

">>door opening"

girl "Mom! Dad!"

"The girl in the doorway beams at us for a second before she locks eyes with me."

girl "Erik, hi!"

erik "Hey, Beatrice."

beatrice "Come in, you guys. Geez, don't just stand there."

"We all squeeze through the door, setting down suitcases while my mother makes motherly apologies."

"<Wilhelm sisters' flat main room (night)>"

mom "I'm sorry we're late! The traffic around here!"

beatrice "It's fun, huh?"

mom "Fun? That's not the word I would use."

beatrice "Hilda! They're here!"

"Once we're all through the door and we've piled our suitcases in the entryway, Beatrice throws her arms around us each in turn."

"The hug is familiar and comforting. It's only been about a month since I last saw her, but even that's way too long."

beatrice "It's so good to see you!"

mom "Where's Hilda?"

hilda "I'm here, I'm here."

"My other sister emerges from some hidden corner of the flat. She offers a quick, dignified kiss to my mother before stopping in front of me."

hilda "Hello, Erik."

"The hug from Hilda is a lot more... professional. One-armed and stiff."

hilda "The bathroom is through there if anyone needs it. Also, we got some takeaway earlier, so that's in the refrigerator."

"Hilda points this way and then that way like she's giving a tour."

hilda "Help yourselves. Beatrice already ate half of it when you weren't here on time, though."

beatrice "I did not! I nibbled!"

mom "Thank you, dear. I think we'll be okay. We should probably get to bed soon, anyway."

mom "Are you hungry, Erik?"

"I shrug."

erik "I'm fine."

"She sends Beatrice off to the kitchen to fetch something for me to eat anyway. For the next few minutes, I pick at a plastic container of Indian food while our mother frets over the sleeping arrangements."

beatrice "You and dad can sleep in our rooms. I don't think we mind hanging out with Erik in here."

mother "Oh, we can share a bed."

beatrice "They're pretty small."

mother "We've shared smaller beds before, dear."

"#Beatrice needs to make a hilarious grossed-out face here"

"They eventually work out the details – with zero input from me; not that I would have had any upon request. I'm ushered into the bathroom to brush my teeth and get ready. I go first – because, as I'm told, I need my rest for the \"big day\" tomorrow."

"<[[timelapse to] Wilhelm sisters' flat hallway (night)>"

"Holding a pillow under one arm and a blanket under the other, I flop onto the couch in the main room of the flat."

"I still feel slightly uncomfortable going to sleep just after we've arrived."

"<fade in \"Unknown Past\">"

"When the commotion in the hallway has subsided, Beatrice comes to join me."

beatrice "Mom and Dad squeezed into my bed somehow. They'd better not be up to any funny business in there."

erik "You're stuck with me then, huh?"

beatrice "Yeah! Hilda didn't seem to want to share hers. And anyway, this way I get to keep my little brother company!"

erik "Thanks."

"It's not the right response, but I don't have anything else to say. I realize how awkward it is immediately."

"Beatrice, as usual, sidesteps awkwardness like a pro."

beatrice "I'll sleep on the floor. You can take the couch."

erik "I'm fine on the floor."

"She laughs and flutters her hand in my direction as if to say, \"Don't be ridiculous.\""

beatrice "You're so sweet, but you're the guest– "

"I plop the pillow and blanket down on the floor and make what I think is a determined face."

"With a sigh, Beatrice sits down next to me and snakes her arm around my shoulders."

beatrice "You hardly ate anything. You sure you're not hungry?"

erik "Yeah, I'm fine."

beatrice "You say that a lot."

erik "Sorry..."

"I do say that a lot, now that I think about it."

erik "I've been getting a lot of 'Are you okay?'s lately."

beatrice "Well, are you?"

erik "I guess, probably. I feel f–"

erik "I feel great."

beatrice "Much better!"

"Beatrice gets up to flip the light switch and we both settle into our respective beds by the dull orange glow of a tiny pumpkin-shaped lamp on the corner table."

"After a few minutes of silence, I can hear her turn under the blankets."

beatrice "You wanna talk about it?"

erik "Talk about what?"

beatrice "How you feel or whatever."

erik "I feel great, remember?"

beatrice "Are you nervous about the school?"

erik "A little."

"By which I mean a lot."

"All that's happened in the last few months, the last thing I need is to top it off with a brand new school in another country."

beatrice "You shouldn't be. I mean, you're still the same Erik. Everybody loved you before. They'll love you here too."

"\"Everyone\" is an overstatement..."

"And despite what Beatrice says, I do feel different than I used to. I just can't explain how."

beatrice "Don't worry too much."

beatrice "We'll have fun tomorrow, I promise. And no parents around to bring down the mood, right?"

erik "Right."

beatrice "Good night, Erik."

"[[close eyes]"
