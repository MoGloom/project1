hilda "He's not awake yet? It's almost noon."

"Urgh."

beatrice "It was a long day, I guess."

"Sunlight squeezes in, between sparkling, sleep-moist eyelids."

"They press shut harder, just for a moment longer..."

"<[[open eyes to] Wilhelm sisters' flat main room (day)>"

"...and then open on a familiar face grinning down at me."

beatrice "Hi."

"I ease myself into a sitting position against the couch."

hilda "Good morning. Still quite the oversleeper, huh?"

"At the edge of my vision, I can see Hilda peering at me over the top of a book from her place on the far chair."

beatrice "Breakfast?"

"My stomach gurgles angrily at the word."

erik "Yeah, I'm starving."

beatrice "I knew you should have eaten more last night! Don't move!"

"Beatrice shoots a finger in the general direction of my face, and then gets up off the floor and bounces off into the kitchen."

"At the other side of the room, I can see Hilda putting down her book."

hilda "Really, though, are you feeling okay? You slept... almost twelve hours?"

erik "I think so."

hilda "Well, if you're wondering, mother and father left earlier to drop your things off at the school. They should be back this afternoon."

"There it is again. \"The school.\""

hilda "You look worried."

"I couldn't tell you what there is to be worried about, but maybe that's the problem. I don't have a clue what to expect."

"Shouldn't a kid heading off to a school a whole country away from his parents feel excited? Liberated? But this isn't just any school."

"And I'm not just any kid."

erik "No, I'm just thinking."

hilda "I know it's probably a scary prospect, getting thrown right into a new school after – "

hilda "When you're still trying to get on your feet, you know?"

erik "I guess."

"It's not my feet I'm worried about."

hilda "You'll do just fine. You were always a good student, not like someone else I could name."

"I can't help thinking Hilda is preparing for a heart-to-heart, but instead, we just drift further into an awkward silence."

"I start considering a run to the toilet."

erik "Um... do you think I can move yet?"

"Her smile is more restrained and understated than Beatrice's. More vivid too, in a way, because she shows it off so much less."

hilda "I won't tell."

beatrice "NO!"

"The cry from the kitchen nearly shakes the floor underneath us. By the tone, I can't tell if she's joking or not, but I'm not going to risk it."

erik "I guess... I'll stay put."

hilda "Probably for the best."

"Beatrice comes back in no time with a plate in hand which she passes to me with a grin on her face."

beatrice "Breakfast in bed!"

"Depends on how loosely you define \"bed.\" Either way, it's a welcome sight."

beatrice "Sorry... the eggs and sausage are a little cold. But the toast is nice and warm! One slice buttered and one with jam, right?"

"I can't help smiling."

erik "...thanks."

"I devour my breakfast as ravenously as I can without coming across like some savage. While I eat, my sisters discuss their plans for the day. It's only a minute or two into the conversation that I realize they're our plans."

"By the sound of it, the three of us are going out on the town whether I like it or not."

beatrice "I wanted to check out the new café."

hilda "Beatrice, Erik just ate breakfast."

beatrice "Yeah, but... he doesn't have to get anything to eat. He could just get coffee, and you guys can leave all the food to me!"

"Hilda sighs exaggeratedly."

hilda "We'll stop by there on the way back, but we need something else to do. We're not going to sit in a café all afternoon and watch you eat."

beatrice "Well, what do you feel like doing, Erik?"

"I'm suddenly pulled into a discussion I didn't expect to have any say in, without much time to think any of it over."

"What do I feel like doing? Honestly..."

"<CHOICE>"
"[[1] I'd be happy just being outside."

"[[2] I'll let them decide."

"<if option [[1]>"

"I have to go out there eventually. And in the light of day, the prospect of facing the world outside seems slightly less terrifying. Fresh air might do me good, anyway."

erik "Can we go for a walk?"

"Beatrice's face brightens instantly at the suggestion."

beatrice "Yeah! Let's go to the park."

hilda "It looks cold out. I was hoping wherever we went, it would be indoors."

beatrice "Oh, come on, Hilda. It'll be fun!"

"She looks to me, as if she expects me to chime in with an excitement rivaling her own. I can't quite reach that level, but I can offer a nod at the very least."

"Good enough. Beatrice doesn't wait for any more deliberation."

beatrice "Right, okay! I'm gonna go get some warm clothes on."

"In a flash, she's gone."

beatrice "Hilda! You have some money for lunch, right?"

"Hilda flashes me with a look when she hears the voice from down the hall. It's something between practiced serenity and perturbed defeat."

beatrice "I'll pay next time!"

"Hilda's face tells me this is generally the accepted arrangement. A reply in actual, spoken words doesn't come."

hilda "We should get ready too. The shower is all yours."

"At her urging, I open the only suitcase my parents left behind, grab from the very top a wad of clothing that seems to consist of all the necessary items, and head for the shower."

"<[[timelapse to]Vienna street (day)>"

"It turns out not to be as cold as we expected. Walking is enough to keep us warm, for the most part, and it's only with the occasional breeze that I actually feel uncomfortably chilled."

"Probably should have dried my hair a little better, in retrospect."

hilda "So, what do you think of Vienna?"

"My older sister keeps her hands in her pockets for the most part while we walk, but every now and then removes one to point at some landmark – a building, a statue, an important-looking street."

erik "It's nice."

"For each one, there seems to have some anecdote or bit of historical context to make it come to life. When I ask about this or that, her speech quickens and she launches into the details with gusto."

"Beatrice shows a different kind of enthusiasm, though, nearly skipping along the sidewalk, swinging her arms at her sides. Every couple minutes, her pace lands her far enough ahead of Hilda and I that she has to stop and wait impatiently for us to catch up."

beatrice "You'll love it here. There's always something to do, even at night, and you don't ever run out of new things to see."

hilda "We can't show you much of the city in one day, but we'd be glad to take you around on the weekends. It's quite a short drive from the school, if you want to visit."

beatrice "Yeah. You can visit whenever you like!"

"But the conversation ends there."

beatrice "We're almost there. Come on!"

"Another minute and we're in the thick of it."

"<[[timelapse to]Vienna park(day)>"

beatrice "Tada!"

"The park didn't exactly appear by magic as the exclamation might suggest.  There's been an unusually colorful patch in the city approaching for more than a block now."

"We start down one of the paths paved with old, weatherworn stones. The trees overhead are a few weeks from beginning to change, but they already have that autumn look about them – gently trembling in the early cold and seeming to hug close to the branches."

hilda "This is one of Beatrice's favorite places. Not counting restaurants or cafés, of course."

beatrice "It's nice to be around nature when you spend so much time in a big city."

"For a while, the three of us walk in silence. Relative silence, anyway, with the occasional comment, always originating from one of the girls and generally not requiring a response from me. So, for that while, my attention drifts outward instead."

"Will the school will be like this? There's a quiet bustle to life in the city, but it feels familiar. Simple."

"Normal."

"I can't imagine St. Dymphna's will fit that description."

"The closer I get to my life at this new school being a reality, the larger it looms in my head like a horrible specter."

"I try to imagine it as a fresh start, but the platitude doesn't even sound convincing in my own head."

beatrice "Now I'm really getting hungry."

"Beatrice pulls me out of my mysings before they get too dark."

beatrice "Hildaaa... Can we get lunch yet?"

"Hilda's eyes are on me, not Beatrice."

erik "It's okay with me."

"All in agreement, we depart for the café Beatrice is so intent on visiting. As it turns out, the walk doesn't take more than fifteen minutes."

"<[[timelapse to] café (day)>"

"We pass from the chilly air and into the warm interior while Beatrice holds the door open. The café is a small, cozy-looking place. The open-air part outside had been mostly abandoned, but almost every table inside is occupied."

"We make our way to the counter, where Beatrice and Hilda go ahead of me to look over our options. Only a moment passes before they turn back to me, their minds already made up."

beatrice "What do you think you're getting, Erik?"

erik "I'm not sure. You guys go first."

"The choices are overwhelming. I lose track of the words written on the blackboard behind the counter and feel a warm, embarrassed panic build at the base of my skull –"

"Until I realise how ridiculous this all is. It's just coffee."

"When the customers ahead of us have moved off, Beatrice bounds forward and leans over the counter like she owns the place."

"Hilda takes longer placing her order, and before she's done, Beatrice has already been handed hers: a cup of creamy-looking coffee and a slice of cake."

hilda "Cake for lunch?"

beatrice "It's a special occasion."

"It may not be proper lunch food, but it does looks good. Like, really good."

erik "I think... I'll have that."

"It's not like my mother is around to scold me for eating desert at lunch time."

beatrice "Huh? The cake?"

erik "Yeah. Why not?"

"Beatrice gloats visibly in Hilda's direction, and I feel my lips curl upward ever so slightly in amusement."

"With all our food and drink settled, Hilda finds us a table in a quiet corner by the window. I position myself with my back to the rest of the café, while Beatrice scoots her chair in next to mine. Across the table, Hilda sips leisurely at a cup of tea."

hilda "Anything on your mind?"

erik "Who, me?"

"Judging by the two pairs of eyes looking in my direction, I'd say yes."

"Well, only one thing's been on my mind all day, really."

erik "Have you seen the school?"

hilda "I drove by after work last week, but you can't see much from the street."

beatrice "I looked up their website. The campus looks really beautiful. Lots of trees and gardens and stuff; you'll like that. The school is this really old, fancy building..."

hilda "I don't think that's what he's asking. If you want to know what it's like there, I couldn't say. You can't tell much from pictures."

beatrice "Yeah, but I have a really good feeling about it!"

"I nod to show that I'm listening as I cut a piece of cake with my fork. Stabbing it, I cautiously lift the chocolatey morsel to my mouth."

beatrice "How is it?"

"It... doesn't taste nearly as good as it looked. And it's dry. Ugh."

erik "It's good."

beatrice "See?"

"She smiles wickedly at her sister."

beatrice "You've got to live a little! Right, Hilda?"

"Hilda crosses her arms."

beatrice "Anyway, we'll always be a phone call away if you ever need anything. And all of us will be there today to make sure you're settled in and everything."

beatrice "I just wish Gustav was here too."

beatrice "Wouldn't it be nice to have the whole family together?"

hilda "I'm sure our brother has his hands full with his new German girl anyway."

beatrice "He has a new girlfriend?"

hilda "I'd be shocked if he didn't."

"From there the conversation dies down for a minute, and when it resumes, it's shifted into realms where I couldn't contribute if I wanted to. They talk about school and work and Beatrice even tells a joke she heard."

"I don't have any school or work to complain about, and I completely blank on any jokes I've heard recently."

"By the time I reach my neglected coffee, it's cooled off considerably, and I could down it in a few gulps if I wanted to, but I take my time with it. Sadly, the coffee doesn't quite do it for me the way the cake did."

"Beatrice has already packed her lunch away somewhere in that thin figure of hers, and I'm just swallowing the last of my coffee when Hilda informs us that the adventure is over."

hilda "It's getting late. We should probably get back to the flat so mother and father aren't waiting."

"With the reminder that I'll soon be shoved into yet another new environment, the cake starts acting up in my stomach."

"In just a few hours, I'll be thrown into a new life."

"At least it's a chance to get out into the world and do my own thing. Maybe I'll try even crazier things than eating cake for lunch."

"<if option [[2]>"

"My sisters know the city better than I do. They'll have a better idea of what we should do."

erik "You guys can decide."

beatrice "But..."

"She pouts at me."

hilda "Why don't we go somewhere quiet? We could look around the book store."

beatrice "But that's so boring..."

hilda "Is that okay with you, Erik?"

erik "Yeah, sure."

"I like the sound of it more than I let on. We'll get out of the house, but it'll still just be the three of us hanging out together."

hilda "Wonderful! I'll go get ready."

hilda "If you're done with breakfast, Erik, you can take a shower. We'll be leaving in fifteen minutes!"

"The last comment I can tell was directed at getting Beatrice moving, who gets up with a huff."

"At her urging, I open the only suitcase my parents left behind, grab from the very top a wad of clothing that seems to consist of all the necessary items, and head for the shower."

"<[[timelapse to]Vienna book store (day)>"

"Hilda takes the wheel for a short car ride to the book store. Only a few minutes and a couple failed attempts at conversation later, the three of us are back indoors."

"The interior of the shop is out of some ancient, forgotten world that smells of decaying paper. But it's a warm sanctuary from the cold outside."

"Despite its unimpressive size, the place is packed to capacity with shelves, which in turn are packed – to capacity – with books. I don't see another human being, though. Not even a clerk manning the front desk."

hilda "Take a look around. If you find something you're interested in, let me know. It'll be my treat."

"Hilda seems at home here, and she walks down the aisles with a sense of purpose. Beatrice flutters over to the magazine section, peeking into one with a picture of a tiger on the cover."

"I, well... wander mostly aimless. I scan the spines along the way, but somehow I feel too awkward to pull any out for a closer look, like it would disturb the sense of stillness that's so pervasive in the place."

"It doesn't help that I keep noticing Hilda out of the corner of my eye, standing perfectly still, her glasses balanced on a downturned nose, with a newly accentuated air of severity and seriousness surrounding her."

"So I just look, but don't touch."

"The subjects slowly change, from non-fiction to fiction. From romance to science fiction and then to historical fiction."

"Then I stop. I can't hold back my curiosity, and one title has grabbed me. I place an index finger on top of the spine and tilt the book onto its corner until I can pull it from where it sits wedged between two thicker, imposing volumes."

"Settling into a worn out chair at the back of the store, I flip through the pages. I think – for a moment – that I've connected with that same homeyness Hilda seems to find here."

"Maybe she knows me better than I thought."

"Not long after, both of my sisters come over to investigate."

hilda "Find anything interesting?"

erik "Yeah. It's a collection of short stories that take place during SOMETHING HISTORICAL"

beatrice "That sounds... really boring."

hilda "And what did you find?"

"Beatrice holds up a different magazine from the one I saw her looking at earlier."

beatrice "Did you know FACT ABOUT HOW MUCH A SPECIFIC ANIMAL EATS?"

hilda "I did, actually."

"Beatrice looks as if she's going to call Hilda's bluff, but then she stops herself."

beatrice "So do you want to take that book home, Erik?"

"Not the most subtle hint that we're taking more time than she'd like."

"My eyes wander over to Hilda for her approval."

hilda "Are you ready to go, Erik?"

"I can tell by her tone that she would be willing to shut Beatrice down as long as I feel like staying here. But Beatrice looks like she'll eat her own foot if we don't leave soon."

erik "Sure."

"Skipping ahead to the desk, Beatrice gives the little bell a few rings while we catch up. From some hiding spot among the books, an old, grave-looking man hobbles over, and I lay my book on the desk."

hilda "So, the café, then?"

beatrice "Definitely! You're paying, right?"

"<[[timelapse to] café (day)>"

"We pass from the chilly air and into the warm interior while Beatrice holds the door open. The café is a small, cozy-looking place. The open-air part outside had been mostly abandoned, but almost every table inside is occupied."

"We make our way to the counter, where Beatrice and Hilda go ahead of me to look over our options. Only a moment passes before they turn back to me, their minds already made up."

beatrice "What do you think you're getting, Erik?"

erik "I'm not sure. You guys go first."

"The choices are overwhelming. I lose track of the words written on the blackboard behind the counter and feel a warm, embarrassed panic build at the base of my skull –"

"The line moves forward and I still haven't made up my mind. Hilda seems to notice my dismay when she turns around again."

hilda "You look a little lost."

erik "There's a lot of options."

beatrice "That's okay. We can pick something for you."





"When the customers ahead of us have moved off, Beatrice and Hilda both step up to order. They argue for a minute about what to get for me, but it seems they make some sort of compromise."

"I notice Beatrice turning away from the counter with a slice of cake sitting on a plate in addition to the coffee in her hand."

hilda "Cake for lunch?"

beatrice "It's a special occasion."

"Hilda picks up two cups, passing one to me. It looks like a dark greyish tea, and smells about as appealing as it looks."

"With all our food and drink settled, Hilda finds us a table in a quiet corner by the window. I position myself with my back to the rest of the café, while Beatrice scoots her chair in next to mine. Across the table, Hilda sips leisurely at a cup of tea."

hilda "Anything on your mind?"

hilda "I don't think that's what he's asking. If you want to know what it's like there, I couldn't say. You can't tell much from pictures."

beatrice "Yeah, but I have a really good feeling about it!"

"I blow on the surface of the tea as they talk, and then finally tilt it toward my mouth and take a sip."

erik "This is amazing. I think this is the best cup of tea I've ever had."

hilda "I told you!"

hilda "Sometimes the simple things turn out the best."

"Beatrice looks defeated."

beatrice "Anyway, we'll always be a phone call away if you ever need anything. And all of us will be there today to make sure you're settled in and everything."

beatrice "I just wish Gustav was here too."

beatrice "Wouldn't it be nice to have the whole family together?"

hilda "It's getting late. We should probably get back to the flat so mother and father aren't waiting."

"With the reminder that I'll soon be shoved into yet another new environment, my tea-filled stomach starts to ache."

"In just a few hours, I'll be thrown into a new life."

"If nothing else, at least it's been a chance to reconnect with my sisters. For everything that's about to change, they're the one thing that I can count on to stay the same."
